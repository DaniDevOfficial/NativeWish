### Idea
Pok√©Wish is a simple expo app that allows you to look at the Pok√©dex via the Pok√©API. There are also some additional features native to phones like vibrations and shaking. 

### Motivation

I used to play a lot of Pok√©mon and watch the series. In the series, I was always fascinated by the Pok√©dex, which is like an encyclopedia. You can scan a Pok√©mon with it and then get information about that Pok√©mon.

## Running
### Installation


To install the app, you need to have the expo-cli installed. You can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

After that, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DaniDevOfficial/PokeWish.git

cd Pok√©Wish

npm install
```

### Usage

To start the app, you can use the following command:

```bash
expo start
```
Scan the QR Code with the Expo go app or look at the app in the browser.


## Story Board


### On the First Screen
The app is simply opened and a GET request is sent to the Pok√©mon API to fetch the data and display it.

### When the User Presses the Next Button
The phone briefly vibrates to inform the user that the press was successful and a new Pok√©mon is loaded.  
Here, the user presses the Next button.  

### Screen 2
The Pok√©mon data is nicely displayed again for viewing. Now, the user shakes the phone and by doing this, a new Pok√©mon is loaded.  
Here, the user shakes the phone.

### User Interactions
The user now knows all interactions/interfaces of the app and can use it exactly as they want.

## Technical Mockup


##### Start Vibration

Actor: User  

Description: The user presses the Next button to make the device vibrate and load a new Pok√©mon.  

Preconditions: The app is open and functional.  

Postconditions: The device vibrates for a specified duration.  

##### Detect Shake Event

Actor: User  

Description: The user shakes the device, and the app detects this and loads a new Pok√©mon.  

Preconditions: The app is open and functional.  

Postconditions: A message is displayed on the screen.  

##### Fetch and Display Pok√©mon Data

Actor: User

Description: When the app starts, Pok√©mon data is fetched from an external API and displayed on the screen.  

Preconditions: The app is open and functional. An internet connection is available.  

Postconditions: Pok√©mon data (e.g., name, image) is displayed.  

#### Non-Functional Requirements
Reliability: The app has an uptime of 99.9%. Maximum crash rate of 1 crash per 1000 sessions.  

Performance: The app loads data from the Pok√©mon API within 2 seconds. Vibration and shake events respond within 200ms.  

Usability: The app provides an intuitive user interface with clear buttons and instructions.  

Compatibility: The app is compatible with Android 10 and above, as well as iOS 13 and above.  

#### Test Concept

##### What devices will be used to test the app?
Devices: Physical Android and iOS devices  

##### How will the app be tested?
Test Methods:  
- Manual Tets: Tests on smartphones  

##### Test Cases
Vibration Tests:  
- Test Case 1: Device vibrates when the button is clicked  
- Test Case 2: Vibration lasts for the specified duration  

Shake Tests:  
- Test Case 1: New Pok√©mon is loaded upon shaking  

API Integration Tests:  
- Test Case 1: Pok√©mon data is successfully fetched and displayed  
- Test Case 2: Error message is displayed when the API is unreachable


## Features

### Planed



### Pok√©mon API 
The app uses the Pok√©API to get the data for the Pok√©dex. You can look at the Pok√©mon and their stats. 

### Vibration
The app is able to vibrate the phone. You can trigger the vibration by pressing the next in the app. This is so you can feel a response when you press the button.

### Shake
The app can also detect when you shake the phone. This is used to trigger the next pokemon.

### Sound 

When the Sprite of the Pok√©mon is pressed, the latest recorded cry of that Pok√©mon will be played. 



### Actualy implemented


- Sound  
- Pok√©mon API
- Vibration
- Shake
- App Icon
- Multi Page Routing





## Design

### Planed

I planed to create a simple App where the stats of the Pok√©mon are displayed with a image and a next button.

### Actualy implemented


I changed the design a bit so it looks better, but held the concept the same.

### Component Diagram


This displays the connection between the components that i used and also shows of the Pok√©API.

### Planing


#### UseCases
The usecases show how the user interacts with the App and how the app is connected to the API.

#### UML Diagram

This shows how the Client interacts with the App but way more detailed.

### Website


Instead of Creating a PlayStore app and spend money I just created a simple website to display a download button.

### Commits

I created relatively atomatic commits inwich each one is only one main thing happening / changing.

## Reflection


At first I didnt realy have any idea on what kind of App to create, but after some thinking I came up with the idea of Pok√©Wish. After that I thought a lot about on how to improve the App with caching, logging and searching, with which I could improve the App in a second week. 


### Planed

I planed to create an app, wich can fetch data from an api via a simple get request and display this data. In addition I wanted to have a Button which refetches the data and vibrates the phone. I also wanted the user to be able to shake the phone to reload the data.

### Acctualy done 

I created a app which is able to fetch data from a api, can display this data in a nice way and has also the next button and the shaking feature. In addition I added multi page with a home page and a poke page. I also added a app icon. I did more than I planed to do. 


### Conclusion

In conclution it helped me to learn about Expo and use my skils from the web to create a mobile application. I also learned, that mobile development is realy similar to web dev but with some minor changes like no onClick but onPress functions and a bit of a different way of styling and writing text.
